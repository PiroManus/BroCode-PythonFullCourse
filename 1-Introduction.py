#Lesson 1: Introduction
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8
print('I love learning Python')
print("It's really fun")


#Lesson 2: Variables
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8
#variable = a container for a value.
# Behaves as the value that it contains
name = "Bro"
print(type(name))
print("Hello " + name)
first_name="Bro"
last_name="Code"
full_name=first_name + last_name
print("Hello "+ full_name)

#when assign value of int type not with quotes
# because cant use strings with math
age = 21
age +=1
#Better way to write above is age +=1
print(age)
print(type(age))
print('Your age is: '+str(age))

#Float
height=250.5
print(height)
print(type(height))

#Boolean. Can only store True or False
human = False
print(human)
print(type(human))


#Lesson 3: Multiple Assignment
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8
#Multiple assignment = allows us to assign multiple variables
# at the same time in one line of code.

name ='Bro'
age = 32
attractive = True
print(name, age, attractive)

#multiple assignment show it is easier to assign.
name, age, attractive= "Bro", 32, True
print(name, age, attractive)

#also multiple assignment
Bill = Tina = Steve = 30
print(Bill)



#Lesson 4: String Methods
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8
# create a new .py file is Ctrl + Alt + Insert
name = "Bro"
#print(len(name))

#this looks for index position of B
print(name.find("B"))

print(name.capitalize())
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
print(name.isdigit())
#isalpha to check if only alphetical letters
print(name.isalpha())
print(name.count("o"))
print(name.replace("o", 'a'))
print(name*3)


#Lesson 5: Type Cast
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8
# type casting = convert the data type of a value
# to another data type.

x = 1     #int
y = 2.0   #float
z = '3'   #str

x = str(x)
y = str(y)
z = str(z)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z*3)

x = float(x)
y = float(y)
z = float(z)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z*3)


#Lesson 6: User Input
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8

name = input("What is your name?: ")
age = int(input("How old are you?: "))
height = float(input("How tall are you?: "))

print("Hello "+name)
print("You are "+str(age)+ " years old")
print("You are "+str(height)+ " feet tall")


#Lesson 7: Math Functions
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8

import math
pi = 3.14
x = 1
y = 2
z = 3

print(round(pi))
print(math.ceil(pi))
print(math.floor(pi))
print(abs(pi))
print(pow(pi, 2)) #raises it to power of 2
print(math.sqrt(pi)) #square root
print(max(pi,x,y,z)) #finds max value
print(min(pi,x,y,z)) #finds min value


#Lesson 8: String Slicing
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8
# slicing = create a substring by extracing elements from
# another string. indexing[] or slice()
# [start:stop:step]
# start index in inclusive. stop index is exclusive.
# step is how much increasing index. default is 1.

name = "Bro Code"
first_name = name[:3]
last_name = name[4:]
funky_name = name[::3]
reversed_name = name[::-1]
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
print(funky_name)

website1 = 'http://test.com'
website2 = 'http://google.com'
slice = slice(7,-4)
print(website1[slice])
print(website2[slice])


#Lesson 9: If Statements
#a block of code that will execute if it's condition is true
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8

age = int(input("How old are you?:"))

if age == 100:
    print("You are a century old!")
elif age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
elif age <0:
    print("You have not been born yet!")
else:
    print("You are a child!")


#Lesson 10: Logical Operators (and, or, not)
#used to check if two or more conditional statements
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8
#I cannot get this to work.
#I want to have it be that the user picks where they live to give answer based on cel vs far

location = input("Do you live in the USA? (Yes or No):")
temp = int(input("What is the temperature outside?:"))

if location == "Yes" or "yes" or "yea" or "Yea":
    location1 = location
else: location2 = location


if location1 == location:
    if temp >= 35 and temp <= 90:
        print("The temperature is good today!")
        print("Go outside!")
    elif temp < 35 or temp > 90:
        print("The temperature is bad today!")
        print("Stay inside!")

elif location2 == location:
    if temp >= 0 and temp <= 30:
        print("The temperature is good today!")
        print("Go outside!")
    elif temp < 0 or temp > 30:
        print("The temperature is bad today!")
        print("Stay inside!")


# not operator: flips it from true to false or reverse
    if not(temp >= 0 and temp <= 30):
        print("The temperature is bad today!")
        print("Stay inside!")
    elif not(temp < 0 or temp > 30):
        print("The temperature is good today!")
